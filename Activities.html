                    <p class = "description">
                        Anyone you ask has a different reason for camping. Some like
                         to disconnect from technology and reconnect with nature. 
                         Some families go camping to revitalize their relationships,
                          away from all the distractions at home. Many youth organizations 
                          teach young people how to build a fire, pitch a tent, or read a
                           compass. Camping means different things to different people. 
                           Some benefits of this activity include improve health both
                            physically and mentally, digital detox, strengthen bonds and
                             relationships, develop life skills.

                        As play during Football is continuous, it is great for fitness
                         and cardiovascular health. People of various ages and skill 
                         levels can participate in football, with those of 
                         various sizes being able to do equally well. 
                         football can also be a great sport for kids who
                          may not have high levels of athletic ability,
                           but who would like to participate in team sports.
                            Moreover, with the location being on Mars, you 
                            will be experiencing this at 0.376g, meaning this
                             will feel like a completely different sport.
