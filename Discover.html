                    At our company, we offer you many different places 
                    that you can discover and enjoy the experience with 
                    your friends, families or even just yourself. During
                     your stay, you can visit these locations and experience
                      the once in a lifetime opportunity to explore without
                       any limits. You can take photos, videos with your 
                       family and make long-lasting memories that will
                        hold a special place in your heart.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our locations 
                        are meant to be very special, therefore, their
                         locations will not be revealed. 
                        Only you yourself must explore planet Mars and 
                        search for them yourself during your stay which is what makes these locations 
                        meaningful and when you find them, it will be extremely rewarding.
                        Though I must warn you now, they are extremely hard to find as
                        there has only been <strong>2 discoveries</strong> so far out of all the 
                        special/hidden locations. Good Luck!!!
